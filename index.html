    <h3>What makes something hyper interactable? <span class="sidenote">this project was created to explore this question.</span> </h3>

    <p> perhaps they are objects which invite interaction, but have no function - when interacted with they allow their users to do exactly nothing.</p>

    <p> they invite for interaction without telling the person interacting with them anything about what they should use the object for - yet their invitation is so strong that they interact with them nonetheless. </p>

    <p>these objects invite their users to define functions for the objects.</p>

    <p>like magical circles whose purpose are lost to us, hyper interactable objects invite for ponderance - what might this entity mean?</p>
